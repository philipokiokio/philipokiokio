### Konnichiwa ‚Äì „Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ üëã
I am Kaizen. This is the name you would see in slack if we get to work together. What is Kaizen? 
Kaizen is a Japanese word for constant self-improvement.  This is a word that I carry and imprint into my everyday life, tasks and career. 

I am a software engineer focused on designing, building and integatrating of services for the creation of optimal server-side applications. I am a Product focused Engineer, which has led me to archtecting solutions that meet business logic. My name Kaizen is a expression of art that I express in software, the evolutionary nature of software means that I will also pivot software to reflect best practises that I learn. I have worked on various solutions that cut across Earth Science, and Marketing. I am expressive and an advocate for documentation. I am always looking to explore more areas and fields, that are outside the scope of my experience. 


I always have product ideas and I am building them out.

### Tech Stack

I have built solely in Python, and a few of its web frameworks like Django, and I currently work with FastAPI, every once in a while I pick up NodeJs or any new language that interests me.

Working and building with FastAPI has been awesome and if I am onboarded to a new project that is language and stack agnostic I will love to build with FastAPI.

I have also picked up a few skills along the way such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, 
Linux skills, deployment on Ubuntu server
