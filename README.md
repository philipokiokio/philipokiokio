### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Kaizen. This is the name you would see in slack if we get to work together. What is Kaizen? 
Kaizen is a Japanese word for constant self-improvement.  This is a word that I carry and imprint into my everyday life, tasks and career. 

I am a software engineer who currently focuses on server-side application development. I have been lucky to build products that are thriving, that cut across Earth Science, GIS project portfolio page, and Marketing and I always looking to explore more areas and fields. 

s. 

I am a dedicated engineer and I love building products.

### Tech Stack

I have built solely in Python, and a few of its web frameworks like Django, and I currently work with FastAPI, every once in a while I pick up NodeJs or any new language that interests me.

Working and building with FastAPI has been awesome and if I am onboarded to a new project that is language and stack agnostic I will love to build with FastAPI.

I have also picked up a few skills along the way such as continuous integration, continuous deployment, 
Linux skills, deployment on Ubuntu server
